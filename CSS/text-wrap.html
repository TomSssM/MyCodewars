  white-space (tells either to not use new lines `nowrap`, use them automatically `normal`, use them as in the markup `pre`)

  overflow-wrap === word-wrap (break the word on letters to fit inside a line, wrapping the part of the word that doesn't fit in onto
  a new line, set this property to `break-word` for such behavior)

  word-break (breaks and wraps words either on hyphens `keep-all`, or on any character `break-all` almost like overflow-wrap or word-wrap,
  see the difference below)

  text-overflow (tells to insert three dots `ellipsis`, or to not do it `clip`, if text overflows container)

  hyphens (algorithm decides where to insert a hyphen based on language, for this set this property to `auto`, we can also make
  CSS insert hyphens only upon encountering special unicode characters - U+2010 and U+00AD - for this set this property to `manual`)

  NOTE: in order to make text overflow the container, you need to make container fixed width (or have the width be limited in some
  other way) and specify `overflow: hidden`.

  NOTE: overflow-wrap is the standard name for its predecessor, the word-wrap property. word-wrap was originally a proprietary
  Internet Explorer-only feature that was eventually supported in all browsers despite not being a standard.
  word-wrap accepts the same values as overflow-wrap and behaves the same way. According to the spec, browsers "must treat word-wrap
  as an alternate name for the overflow-wrap property, as if it were a shorthand of overflow-wrap". Also, all user agents are required
  to support word-wrap indefinitely, for legacy reasons.

  NOTE: overflow-wrap (or word-wrap) is different from word-break in that it breaks only the word that exceeds the width of
  the container (a word that cannot fit into the container is split on some letter and the part that remains after the word
  is split wraps onto a new line), however, if the length of the word doesn't exceed the length of the container, then it wraps
  the entire word onto a new line without breaking it. word-break on the other hand wraps the word on a new line as soon as any
  letter of the word touches the edge of the container (the letters following the letter that is touching the edge of the container
  are wrapped onto a new line). Therefore word-break is different from overflow-wrap (or word-wrap) in that it splits and wraps a word
  as soon as the word reaches the edge of the container.

  NOTE: hyphens property does not insert hyphens at the same places where words are wrapped onto a new line by overflow-wrap, word-wrap
  or word-break properties.
