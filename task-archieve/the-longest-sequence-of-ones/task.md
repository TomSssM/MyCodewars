# The Longest Sequence of Ones

Your task is to implement algorithm that finds the longest sequence of 1's in array consisting of 1's and 0's. For this task you also have to exclude at least 1 element out of the array, for example:

```js
countOnes([1, 0]); // 1
countOnes([1, 1]); // 1 (because we have to throw away at least one element, thus we throw away 1)
countOnes([0, 0]); // 0
countOnes([1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]); // 4 (we throw away 0 at index 3 and get four 1's)
```
