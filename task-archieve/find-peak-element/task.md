# Find Peak Element

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors

Given a __0-indexed__ integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to __any of the peaks__

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž`. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array

__Example 1:__

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6
```

<summary>Task Type</summary>

This is simply a type of task where we iterate an array using one pointer (pointer is when we save number to variable like `i` and use `i` as an index of the array and increment `i` per iteration) and get the solution

We have already seen a similar task called [Love Triangle](../../cheatsheet/love-triangles.js). To solve that task we also simply iterate an array (and do certain things as we iterate it of course)

_Note:_ in the Love Triangle task as we iterate the array we also employ a technique where we use _values_ of elements of the array as _indexes_ (in order to check if there is a cycle)
