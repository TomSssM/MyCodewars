# Top K Frequent Elements

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `k` most frequent elements. You may return the answer in __any order__

__Example 1:__

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```

<summary>Task Type</summary>

It is a One Pointer One Array and HashMap Task Type. In order to solve it you need to create HashMap and iterate this HashMap in some way just like in [this task](../partition-labels/task.md). Just don't be fooled by the mention of "any order" in the task description into thinking it is a Task Type for Backtracking Depth-first Search of Array
