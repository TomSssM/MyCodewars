# Task Type Summary

> :bulb: Feel free to revise all the algorithm examples under the spoiler "Code". There are mysterious functions called `logic()` and `condition()`. These functions are where the business logic of a particular Task lives. Also note that not every Approach can be given a "Code" section spoiler (it is very rare but it happens), for such Approaches solve the corresponding Tasks
