# Task Type Summary

> :bulb: Feel free to revise all the algorithm examples under the spoiler "Code". There are mysterious functions called `logic()` and `condition()`. These functions are where the business logic of a particular Task lives. Also note that not every Approach can be given a "Code" section spoiler (it is very rare but it happens), for such Approaches solve the corresponding Tasks

> :bulb: `approach2(...)` means that the posssibilities of further actions are so vast that it is surely going to be some other Approach used in that place thereby making the solution a combination of two Approaches instead of just one (and the immediate business logic of the Task of course). The same is if you encounter `approach3(...)` then it is going to be a combination of 3 Approaches and so forth

> :bulb: One should also consider using recursion especially with simple Approaches
