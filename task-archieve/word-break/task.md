# Word Break

Given a string `s` and a dictionary of strings `wordDict`, return `true` if `s` can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words

__Note__ that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation

__Example 1:__

```
Input: s = "mycodewars", wordDict = ["my","codewars"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "mycodewars" can be segmented as "my codewars"
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple"
Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word
```

__Example 3:__

```
Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
Output: false
```
