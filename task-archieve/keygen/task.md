# Keygen

Your task is to write a function that accepts two arguments:
1. count of elements in array
2. sum of these elements (the elements of the array are numbers)

The function should randomly generate the array that fits the requirements above. Also there should not be zeros in the generated array

Here are a few examples:

```js
function keygen(count, sum) {
  // ...your code
}

keygen(5, 10); // => [3, 2, 1, 3, 1]
keygen(4, 13); // => [2, 5, 3, 3]
```

<summary>Task Type</summary>

This is more of a numbers task type than any of the array task types
