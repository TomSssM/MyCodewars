# Find Peak Element

> [Solutions](./solutions.md)

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors

Given a __0-indexed__ integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to __any of the peaks__

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž`. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array

__Example 1:__

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6
```
